This is an experiment I made using only [Termux](https://termux.com/) on my mobile phone.

I've installed Termux, and using it I installed PHP and Git.

After that I just made a very simple program in PHP to show on the terminal the instructions to make a drink, loaded from [TheCocktailDB](https://www.thecocktaildb.com/).

I just wanted to see if I could init a repository and push it to GitHub using a command line app in my smartphone.
